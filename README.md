# LED-Strip-Control-Website
Website that allows changing RGB values of an LED strip. The website runs on your laptop.

# How it works:
Code relies on an LED Strip of 16 lights that's connected to an Arduino wemos d1 mini. It reads data from the MQTT server tome.lu.
On the website, you can change the different RGB values using a color picker.
